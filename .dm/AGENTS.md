# .dm/AGENTS.md

This subtree contains gameplay state and runtime documentation.

- Do not activate play mode solely because work is in `.dm/`.
- Follow root routing in `AGENTS.md` for mode selection.
- Load `.dm/PLAY_MODE.md` only after explicit play intent (`/play`, start campaign, resume campaign).
